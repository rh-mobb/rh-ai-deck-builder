  SLIDE 3  -  Agenda / talk overview (two-column outline)

============================================================ -->

# This Talk

<div class="cols-2">
<div>

**A hook statement  -  a number, a problem, a tension.**

One or two sentences that set the stakes. Why should the audience care right now? What will they leave with?

</div>
<div>

**What we'll cover:**

1. Context and background
2. The core problem
3. How we approached it
4. The key findings
5. Patterns to take home

</div>
</div>

<!--
Use the left column for the "why this matters" and the right for the agenda.
Keep agenda items short  -  they'll reappear as section headers.
Brand rule: agenda lists max 5-6 items per column. Split into two columns (cols-2) if the talk has more than 6 sections.
-->

---
layout: section
class: section-header
---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 4  -  Section header
  Marks the start of a major section. layout: section + class:
  section-header together render the h1 in large red type with
  no left-border accent. The h2 is the section subtitle.
============================================================ -->

# Section 1
## Context and Background

<!--
Section headers give the audience a landmark. Keep the h1 to a section
number or short label; use h2 for the full title so it can wrap naturally.
Brand rule: divider text ≤3 lines. Optional: add supporting copy to a right column using cols-2.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 5  -  Two-column comparison (RhTwoColumn component)
  Best for contrast: before/after, option A vs B, human vs AI.
  Uses named slots #left and #right. Put Mermaid diagrams OUTSIDE
  this component  -  they won't render inside slots.
============================================================ -->

# Two-Column Comparison

<RhTwoColumn>
  <template #left>

  ### Option A (or: Before)
  - First point about option A
  - Second point  -  keep bullets tight
  - Third point  -  one idea per bullet

  </template>
  <template #right>

  ### Option B (or: After)
  - First point about option B
  - Second point
  - Third point

  </template>
</RhTwoColumn>

> *A memorable one-line takeaway that names the winner or frames the trade-off.*

<!--
RhTwoColumn is a thin wrapper around the .cols-2 grid utility.
Tip: Use ### headings inside the slots to label each column clearly.
The blockquote accent at the bottom anchors the takeaway message.
Brand rule: slide title ≤1 line on content slides. If you need more context, put it in the ### headings or the blockquote, not the h1.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 6  -  Bullet list (standard content slide)
  The workhorse format. One strong headline, 3-5 bullets,
  optional blockquote for emphasis. Avoid sub-bullets where possible.
============================================================ -->

# Key Findings

- **Bold label for first point**  -  supporting detail in regular weight
- **Second finding**  -  brief explanation; one clause is enough
- **Third finding**  -  if you need more detail, add a second sentence here
- **Fourth finding**  -  keep the list to 4-5 items max; split the slide otherwise

<div class="mt-6 text-[var(--rh-muted)] text-sm">

Optional callout paragraph in muted text  -  good for caveats, context, or attribution.

</div>

> *Blockquote for the single most important idea on this slide.*

<!--
This is the safest layout. When in doubt, use it.
Rule of thumb: if the bullets need sub-bullets, split into two slides.
Brand rule: title ≤1 line. Keep bullets to 4-5 items max — beyond that, split the slide.
If any claim comes from external research, add a source line at the bottom: `Source: Name, Year`.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 7  -  Code block (syntax-highlighted)
  Shiki handles highlighting automatically. Wrap long lines.
  For before/after code comparisons, use two fenced blocks with
  ### headings between them  -  see the pattern below.
============================================================ -->

# Code Example

### The problem

```python
# Fragile: direct string formatting, no validation
def connect(host, port):
    url = "http://" + host + ":" + str(port)
    return requests.get(url)
```

### The fix

```python
# Robust: validated URL construction with timeout
from urllib.parse import urlunparse

def connect(host: str, port: int, timeout: int = 10):
    url = urlunparse(("http", f"{host}:{port}", "/", "", "", ""))
    return requests.get(url, timeout=timeout)
```

> *The fix is one function change. The headline is why it matters.*

<!--
Use ### headings to label before/after blocks. Keep code excerpts short  -  
if the block scrolls, split the slide or extract the key lines.
lineNumbers: false is set globally; enable per-block with {lines:true} in the fence.
Brand rule: code slides rarely need a source, but do credit external snippets with a muted caption below the block.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 8  -  Table (RhTable component)
  Props-driven: pass headers as a string array and rows as a 2D array.
  All cell content is plain text  -  no HTML inside cells.
  For rich cell content (badges, links), use a custom component.
============================================================ -->

# Comparison Table

<RhTable
  :headers="['Dimension', 'Approach A', 'Approach B', 'Notes']"
  :rows="[
    ['Setup time',    'Minutes',  'Hours',    'A uses defaults; B is fully custom'],
    ['Flexibility',   'Low',      'High',     'B supports all edge cases'],
    ['Operational complexity', 'Low', 'Medium', 'B requires ongoing tuning'],
    ['Recommended for', 'Teams starting out', 'Production at scale', ''],
  ]"
/>

<div class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--rh-muted)]">

Add a sentence below the table to draw the reader's eye to the most important row or column.

</div>

<div class="mt-2 text-xs text-[var(--rh-muted)]">

Source: Your Source, Year

</div>

<!--
RhTable renders a full-width responsive table with RH styling.
Keep tables to 4 columns or fewer  -  they compress badly at slide scale.
For wider data, consider splitting into two tables or using a bullet list.
Brand rule: always include a source line on data slides. Delete it only if the data is self-generated or obvious.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 9  -  Mermaid flowchart
  Mermaid blocks MUST sit in plain slide Markdown  -  not inside
  Vue component slots. Use flowchart LR for left-to-right flows,
  TD for top-down. Avoid inline styles (fill:#, color:)  -  they
  break in dark mode. Use style statements instead if needed.
============================================================ -->

# System Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  userRequest["User Request"]
  auth["Auth Service"]
  api["API Gateway"]
  db[("Database")]
  cache["Cache"]
  response["Response"]

  userRequest --> auth
  auth -->|"valid token"| api
  auth -->|"reject"| response
  api --> cache
  cache -->|"hit"| response
  cache -->|"miss"| db
  db --> cache
  db --> response
```

<!--
flowchart LR keeps wide diagrams readable. Use node IDs without spaces
(camelCase or underscores). Quote edge labels that contain special chars:
  A -->|"O(1) lookup"| B   ← correct
  A -->|O(1) lookup| B     ← breaks (parens parsed as node syntax)
Brand rule: diagram slides benefit from a muted source or attribution line if the architecture is from an external reference.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 10  -  Mermaid state diagram (lifecycle / process flow)
  stateDiagram-v2 with direction LR keeps it compact.
  Good for showing how something moves through states over time.
============================================================ -->

# State / Lifecycle Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  direction LR
  [*] --> Pending: Created
  Pending --> Running: Scheduled
  Running --> Succeeded: Completed
  Running --> Failed: Error
  Failed --> Pending: Retried
  Succeeded --> [*]
  Failed --> [*]: Abandoned
```

<div class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--rh-muted)]">

Add a sentence explaining what triggers the key transitions in your system.

</div>

<!--
stateDiagram-v2 is ideal for CRD reconciliation loops, CI pipelines,
request lifecycles, or any process with defined states.
Keep to 6-8 states  -  beyond that, split or use a flowchart.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 11  -  Image slide (full-height image with caption)
  Put images in public/  -  they're served at /filename.png.
  The .rh-image-slide wrapper + flex layout fills the available
  height below the title and caption without overflowing.
  Remove the <p> caption if you want the image to fill more space.
============================================================ -->

# Architecture Diagram

<div class="rh-image-slide">

A brief caption explaining what the diagram shows and what to focus on.

<div class="rh-image-slide__figure">
<img
  src="/osd-gcp-arch.png"
  alt="GCP customer project: Customer VPC with worker VMs, Red Hat-managed control plane, internal LB, Cloud NAT, ingress load balancer"
/>
</div>

</div>

<!--
Always write a meaningful alt attribute  -  it doubles as context for AI agents
reading the slide source without rendering the image.
For diagrams that change frequently, consider Mermaid instead of a PNG so
source diffs are readable and the image never goes stale.
-->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

<!-- SLIDE 12  -  Quote / stat callout
  layout: center + class: text-center centres everything.
  Good for a big moment: a key finding, a memorable quote, a stat
  that reframes the conversation. -->

# The Number That Changes Everything

<div class="text-6xl font-bold mt-6" style="color: var(--rh-red); font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif">
42%
</div>

<div class="text-2xl mt-4 text-[var(--rh-muted)]">
of teams that adopt X see Y within 90 days
</div>

<div class="mt-8 text-sm text-[var(--rh-muted)]">
Source: Your Citation, Year
</div>

<!--
Use this format sparingly  -  one per major section at most.
The number or quote should be the single most important data point on this slide. Everything else is context.
Brand rule: always cite the source. If you can't name the source, don't use the stat.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 13  -  Spectrum / maturity scale (RhSpectrum component)
  Shows a progression from basic to advanced, highlighting
  where your subject sits. Stages with active: true are red.
  leftLabel and rightLabel label the ends of the scale.
============================================================ -->

# Where Does This Fit?

<RhSpectrum
  :stages="[
    { label: 'Manual\nProcess',      icon: '🖐️' },
    { label: 'Scripted\nAutomation', icon: '📜' },
    { label: 'CI/CD\nPipeline',      icon: '⚙️' },
    { label: 'Self-Healing\nSystem',  icon: '🔄', active: true },
  ]"
  left-label="← ad-hoc"
  right-label="production-ready →"
/>

<div class="mt-6 text-[var(--rh-muted)] text-sm">

This talk is about reaching the highlighted position  -  and what it takes to get there reliably.

</div>

<!--
RhSpectrum is good for framing ambition or positioning your technology
on a maturity curve. Keep to 4-5 stages  -  beyond that the labels compress.
The active stage draws the eye without needing a pointer.
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================
  SLIDE 14  -  Timeline (RhTimeline component)
  Horizontal milestone timeline. Each milestone has a date,
  label (supports \n for line breaks), and optional color.
  The legend prop adds a colour key below the timeline.
============================================================ -->

# Project Timeline

<RhTimeline
  :milestones="[
    { date: 'Week 1',  label: 'Discovery\n& scoping',    color: '#73BCF7' },
    { date: 'Week 3',  label: 'First\nprototype',        color: '#73BCF7' },
    { date: 'Week 5',  label: 'Stakeholder\nreview',     color: '#F0AB00' },
    { date: 'Week 7',  label: 'Iteration\n& testing',    color: '#F0AB00' },
    { date: 'Week 10', label: 'Production\nlaunch',      color: '#5BA352' },
  ]"
  :legend="[
    { color: '#73BCF7', label: 'Build' },
    { color: '#F0AB00', label: 'Review' },
    { color: '#5BA352', label: 'Ship' },
  ]"
/>

<div class="mt-4 text-sm text-[var(--rh-muted)]">

Add a sentence noting any surprises, pivots, or lessons from the timeline.

</div>

<!--
RhTimeline takes milestones and an optional legend. Colors are free-form
CSS color strings  -  use the RH palette variables where possible:
  #73BCF7 = --rh-blue, #EE0000 = --rh-red, #5BA352 = --rh-green,
  #F0AB00 = --rh-yellow
-->

<!-- SLIDE 15  -  Closing / CTA
  layout: center + class: text-center for a centred layout.
  The large headline is the single message you want the audience
  to leave with. Links go below in muted text. -->

# Your Closing Line Here.

<div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4" style="color: var(--rh-red); font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif">
A bold, memorable second line  - <br />the thing you want people to repeat.

<div class="mt-6 text-xs italic" style="color: var(--rh-muted)">

*An optional light closer  -  a callback to a joke from earlier, a thank-you, or a next step.*

</div>

<!--
The closing slide should leave one idea ringing in the audience's ears.
The red subheadline is the most prominent visual element  -  make it count.
Links give people something to do after the talk; keep to 2-3.
-->

---

<!-- SLIDE 16  -  Reactive phase animation (Pattern B)
  Use a self-contained Vue component to animate a multi-state diagram.
  The component loops automatically and lets the presenter pause on any
  state by clicking the phase dot  -  no Slidev click progressions needed.

  When to use this pattern:
    - You have a before/during/after story (steady state → event → recovery)
    - The diagram has 3–6 distinct states that each deserve explanation
    - You want the slide to be live during Q&A, not frozen on one frame

  See AGENTS.md → "Animated components → Pattern B" for the full guide.
  The reference implementation is components/PhaseAnimation.vue. -->

# How Balloon Pods Work

<div class="text-sm text-[var(--rh-muted)] text-center mb-4">

Low-priority **pause Pods** reserve capacity ahead of bursts  -  the scheduler preempts them
instantly when real workloads arrive, bridging **seconds-scale HPA decisions** and
**minute-scale node provisioning**.

</div>

<PhaseAnimation />

<!--
Speaker note: Walk through each phase using the dot controls  -  click a dot to jump to
that state and pause, then explain it before resuming. The animation loops automatically
when not paused, so it's self-running while the audience reads around it.

Phase 1 (At Rest): balloons hold warm slots, zero CPU consumed.
Phase 2 (Spike): scheduler evicts balloons in < 1 second  -  users see no interruption.
Phase 3 (Provisioning): autoscaler restores headroom in the background (5–7 min).
Phase 4 (Restored): back to steady state, ready for the next spike.
-->
